Holla! ðŸ‘‹

On dndnd I got a chance as 1 of selected 100 participant (from 700+) to compete in Telkomsel.....
Although I  can not manage to secure to 30 place, I still grateful to given a chance exposed to dnjdnvndjv

On this repo, I will share 2 sql question from the competition and add my approach to solve the question.

### Question 1: Election

 ```
 Given a database of the results of an election, find the number of seats won by each party. 
 There are some rules to going about this:
 - There are many constituencies in a state and many candidates who are contesting the election from each constituency.
 - Each candidate belongs to a party
 - The candidate with the maximum number of votes in a given constituency wins for that constituency.
 
 The output should be in the following format: party | seats_won
 The ordering should be in the order of seats won in descending order.
 ```

### Question 2: Cities with More Customers Than Average

```
Write a query which will return all cities with more customers than the average number of customers of all cities.
For each such city, return the country name, the city name and the number of customers. 
Order the result by country name ascending.
```
